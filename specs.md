# Requirements of the project:
  1) You must use a HashMap to store the data in the file CityData.dat.
  2) You must use what you learned in Lab 13 - Prime Numbers to read in and parse the data.
  3) You must have an output file that also gets saved in the same folder.

# What do you do with the data?  
Up to you!  Write something interesting.  Here are ideas:
  1) What is the Big O of the Hashmap methods?  Use Javaâ€™s Time() class to calculate how long it takes to process a method.  Run it multiple times.  Use that data in a chart. To extrapolate if this method takes 1.500 seconds and another method is 2.250 seconds, is the second method O(n-squared) while the first is O(n)?  Maybe test it on multiple data files.  Or smaller version of CityData.dat.
  2) Create a database that looks up populations in a city.  Create a runner class that helps a user find a city in the list and report the population.  Is the runner a GUI or command line?
  3) Got another idea?  Run it by the teacher!
